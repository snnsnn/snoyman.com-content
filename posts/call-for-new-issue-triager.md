For those unfamiliar with it, Stack has a team called the "Stack Issue
Triagers." If you've been interacting on the Stack issue tracker recently, it's
likely that those are the people you've seen answering questions. We've been
slowly ramping up the team, and it seems to have been quite successful so far
at helping Stack users, as well as escalating issues and getting them resolved
as necessary.

We're looking to expand the team again. This team is a volunteer effort, with
each person taking a week at a time of responding to issues. We have a lot more
information on this in the [team process Stack
documentation](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/master/doc/maintainers/team_process.md).
Working with this team is not only a great service to the community, but also
gives you a chance to learn more about maintaining a large open source Haskell
codebase, and gives you many opportunities to interact with the Stack maintainers.

For now, we're adding 1 new person to the team, though we'll likely add another
one in three months time, and continue the ramp up process from there. If
you're interested in taking part, please send me a private email to `michael at
snoyman dot com`.

 I'll collect applicants and discuss with the team members. If you have
questions about the process, please feel free to ask on the [Gitter Stack
chat](https://gitter.im/commercialhaskell/stack)!
