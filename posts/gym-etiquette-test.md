Miriam (aka [@LambdaMom](https://twitter.com/lambdamom)) and I are
writing this blog post as a public service announcement, to address a
true scourge in modern society. All too often, gymgoers do not know
basic gym etiquette:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me: spends ten minutes finding a complete set of matching plates and set them up on the squat rack where I&#39;m working.<br><br>Some guy: comes over, takes some plates, and THEN DOESN&#39;T PUT THEM BACK WHEN HE&#39;S DONE.<br><br>Dude. I&#39;m still here. 2 feet away from you. You can see I&#39;m still here.</p>&mdash; Miriam Snoyman (@LambdaMom) <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaMom/status/1110429427329126401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In response to this pandemic, we move that all gyms institute,
immediately, a required exam for gym membership. There shall be no
"grandfathering" of existing members; all existing members must submit
to the test. Anyone scoring below a 90% should be forbidden from
entering the gym until they have taken a "basic human decency in the
gym" course.

Gyms: for your convenience, we have provided a set of twenty questions
below. This is a multiple choice exam, where each statement can be
answered with:

* Required- you must behave this way in the gym
* Recommended- this is good behavior
* Frowned upon- try to avoid doing this
* Forbidden- you will be ejected immediately from the gym

* * *

1. **I'm done chewing this piece of gum, let me put it on this plate** [Forbidden](https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/955681808368226304?s=20)

5. **I just finished a set of tricep extensions, let me lift my shirt and check out how my abs look** Frowned upon
6. **Curling in the squat rack** Frowned upon, unless someone's waiting to use the squat rack, then your life is in your own hands
7. **Telling someone lifting heavy weights to put them down more quietly** Frowned upon
