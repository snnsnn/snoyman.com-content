        <h1>Experience</h1>

        <h2>FP Complete, Vice President of Engineering</h2>
        <h3>August 2012 to Present</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Designed architecture and oversaw implementation for multiple projects in the life sciences, FinTech, and blockchain space, including software development, DevOps, quality assurance, and project management. See <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/case-study">FP Complete case studies</a> for more details.</li>
          <li>Spearheaded the <a href="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage project</a>, a curated set of Haskell packages tested for compatibility. The Stackage project contains around 2000 packages and oversees contributions from hundreds of contributors, with a team of volunteer curators. Oversaw creation of build tooling and devops infrastructure to automate builds and host build artifacts (such as documentation).</li>
          <li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/">Stack build tool</a>, initially for internal and customer work, ultimately rolling out to the community at large. Stack is an ambitious tool, supporting management of the Haskell toolchain, usage of curated package sets, reproducible build plans, and more advanced features like Docker integration. From many customer and community reports, Stack has revolutionized the way companies and individuals adopt Haskell.</li>
          <li>Managed the FP Haskell Center project, the first commercial Haskell IDE. Ultimately this project was discontinued and replaced with a separate <a href="https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/">School of Haskell</a> and focus on client-side build tools (including Stack and Intero). The technologies developed in this project became the basis for the FP Complete devops toolchain, now run as its own line of business within the company.</li>
          <li>Managed engineering efforts across a 30+ engineer team creating a Haskell FDA regulated medical device. This project pushed the boundaries on Haskell adoption within a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company, and demonstrated the power cloud based computing could provide for scalable data science computing power. Our team created a low latency, scalable, and fault tolerant distributed computation framework for performing 500+ core monte carlo simulations in pure Haskell. We additionally created a complete systems test framework, FDA compliant RESTful frontend server, and various devops systems around the management of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</li>
          <li>Managed multiple concurrent customer projects from the FP Complete side, providing Haskell implementation, devops implementation, network architecture, software architecture, testing, and training to geographically distributed customers with our fully remote team.</li>
          <li>Developed and maintained many Haskell resources, including libraries, training material, and documentation. Some notable contributions have included materials to address complex issues in the Haskell toolchain like asynchronous exceptions and control functions in monad transformer stacks. The goal has been, and continues to be, to make it easy and straightforward for developers to write correct and efficient code with Haskell.</li>
          <li>Wrote articles and <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/#talks">delivered talks</a> on many educations topics in software development, especially focused on Haskell and Rust</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Suite Solutions</h2>
        <h3>November 2010 to September 2012</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Created industry leading webhelp system (<a href="http://www.suite-sol.com/pages/solutions/suitehelp.html">SuiteHelp</a>) based on modern, open standards.</li>
          <li>Produced industry's first fully DITA based social document system (<a href="http://www.suite-sol.com/pages/solutions/suite-social-kb.html">SuiteShare</a>).</li>
          <li>Authored numerous XML to XSL-FO conversion systems.</li>
          <li>Provided solutions for numerous global, Fortune 500 companies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Yesod Web Framework</h2>
        <h3>March 2009 to present</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Authored dozens of Haskell packages providing a basis for the Yesod Web Framework, covering templating, web server, database persistence, and handler functionality.</li>
          <li>Created the premier web application framework in the Haskell community, focusing on type safety, robustness, and developer productivity.</li>
          <li>Wrote core Haskell libraries, such as HTTP client, XML parsing and rendering, streaming data (conduit), YAML binding</li>
          <li>Code available on Github in my <a href="https://github.com/snoyberg">personal account</a> or <a href="https://github.com/yesodweb">yesodweb organization</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Senior Actuarial Analyst, Farmers Insurance Group</h2>
        <h3>July 2006 to March 2009</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Facilitated production of a complete factor refresh for the auto book of business through use of the COM+ protocol, external Generalized Linear Modeling tools, modified binary files and Excel user interface. Provided users with flexibility to determine for each variable how rates would be determined (offset, interacted, grouped, or simple categorical).</li>
          <li>Adapted ratemaking process for entire homeowners book of business to reflect previously uncalculated effects of differing loss experience between lines.</li>
          <li>Created reports to provide insight into business patterns based on exposure shifts. Provided both precision at the granular level as well as high-level overviews.</li>
          <li>Restructured multiple data pulling programs to reflect changes in business practice, to streamline execution and to ease maintenance.</li>
          <li>Provided assistance in dealing with various legacy database systems and in integrating across different platforms.</li>
        </ul>
